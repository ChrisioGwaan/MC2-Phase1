For this reason, a model that can predict passenger's satisfaction level will be useful. For example, airlines can earn more income by improving their service using the predictive model. Likewise, using the predictive model can benefit passengers by increase the quality of service. More importantly, airlines can maintain a good reputation and become more competitive in the market.\n",
